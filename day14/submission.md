### I-B

```
f(n) = n^2 + 2n + 6
g(n) = 6n^2 - 25

Find k, n0 where f(n) <= g(n) for n > n0

Let k = 1
Let n0 = 3

(3)^2 + 2(3) + 6 <= 6(3)^2 - 25
21 <= 29    <<<< k and n0 are valid.

[k = 1, n0 = 3]
```

### I-C

```
f(n) = n^3 + n^2 - 2n
g(n) = 6n^2 - 25

This problem is impossible b/c n^3 is a higher power than n^2. f(n) will grow
non-linearly faster than g(n).
```

### I-D

```
f(n) = 869,438
g(n) = 923

Let k = Ceil((869,438 / 923) + 1) = 943
Let n0 = 0

869,438 <= 943 * 923
869,438 <= 870,389  <<<< k and n0 are valid.

[k = 943, n0 = 0]
```
